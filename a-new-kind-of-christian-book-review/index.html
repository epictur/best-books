<p>Winston the hero of the story is confessing to his diary a sexual encounter with a prostitute. Phil Groom reviews Brian D McLarens A New Kind of Christian - Its easy to get lost in the post - but its supposed to happen to letters not people. A New Kind of Christian challenged me to really look at where my views about certain issues came from and what the Jesus approach to them would be. Brian McLarens two most important books &ndash; A New Kind of Christian and the recent A Generous Orthodoxy both open by raising the specter of an evangelical pastor leaving the ministry or the church altogetherThe fictional lead character in New Kind is poised to abandon his ministry until a wise new friend initiates him into the ways of postmodern Christianity rehabilitating his. Generous Orthodoxy gave us a critique of both sides and some glimpses of a third way even if the book frustrated to no end by leaving too many loose ends dangling.

<p>A Leadership Network Publication A New Kind of Christians conversation between a pastor and his daughters high school science teacher reveals that wisdom for lifes most pressing spiritual questions can come from the most unlikely sources. After finishing the book and reflecting on it I would call myself more of a friendly critic finding it less helpful than I would have hoped and more dangerous than I. Subsequently I found his novelistic series A New Kind of Christian to be both inviting and engagingFour years ago McLaren moved from full-time. And this is why he is seeking as the title of his book declares. Some books provide us with information about the world but every once in a while a book appears that enables us to imagine new more wonderful worlds.
