<p>Amanda Knox has called on freed killer Rudy Guede to admit he acted alone in murdering Meredith Kercher and restore her wrongly damaged reputation. May 10 2013 Tom rated it it was amazing review of another edition Amanda Knox is certainly a polarizing figure. Anyone interested in the case and the Italian justice system will find it both fascinating and horrifying.
