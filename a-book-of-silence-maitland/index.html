<p>Eight years through the still-ongoing process she wrote about her endeavor in A Book of Silence. She found herself thinking more about silence about seeking a quieter kind of life as well as exploring and becoming more attuned to her faith. Her story culminates in her building a hermitage on an isolated moor in Galloway and as she guides readers through experiences of silence in this new home she evokes a sense of peace that includes the reader in its intimate tranquility. Maitland sets out from a place of loving concern full of tenderness for the human condition and hope that we might fulfill our best destinies. In the first chapter Maitland is sitting on the porch of her house on a high moor in Englands County Durham on a warm October morning with nothing in my diary for the next fortnight.
