<p>After is now the first novel in a five-book series and was made into a film in 2019. Hes rude and condescending towards her nothing like her. The movie is based on the After series which originally started out as One Direction fan fiction on an app called Wattpad. Tessa Young is an 18 year old college student with a simple life excellent grades and a sweet boyfriend. The After series is a New Adult series of four books that tell the love story between a straight-laced college freshman Tessa and an emotionally damaged young man named Hardin who is filled with so much anger and hate for himself and the world around him that it affects his every relationshipespecially his relationship with Tessa.
