<p>Self-help books were also affected by this trend. After all the lessons we want to pass on to others often originate with personal experience. A memoir can be a piece of self-help writing whether it be in the form of an essay an Op-Ed or a book-length piece. Probably anywhere from 40000 to 90000 words.
