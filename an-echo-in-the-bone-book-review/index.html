<p>This is the 7th book in the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. I dont mind that it took time to read &mdash; in fact I relished it &mdash; but I dont live in a car culture and its impossible to tote the current volume along with me on the subway. 50 out of 5 starsIntense and satisfying. Centered on time travelling 20th century doctor Claire Fraser and her 18th century Scottish Highlander warrior husband Jamie Fraser the books contain elements of historical fiction romance adventure and fantasy. NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER The seventh book in Diana Gabaldons acclaimed Outlander saga the basis for the Starz original series.

<p>Jamie Fraser erstwhile Jacobite and reluctant rebel knows three things about the American rebellion. Free delivery on qualified orders. If you havent noticed this already the Outlander series is a slow-burn type of read. July Book ClubWelcome to Book Club Yall. This book was well written but not as exciting a page turner in the middle as the other books in the series but its still an excellent book and the story is good.

<p>There was so much going on in this book and so many characters to keep track of it became quite a feat to keep up. I have to respectfully disagree with some of the reviews because I thought this book was absolutely fantastic. It really feels like a true story of Claire and Jamies lives. It is always interesting to read reviews and see the difference in opinion. The ending seemed too rushed and to be honest Im sorry not for one minute do I believe that Claire would do what she did it seemed totally unnatural for her especially how much in love she is with Jamie and the connection they share.
