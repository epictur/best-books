<p>The WHO Essential Medicines List Antibiotic Book. This event is to introduce the WHO Essential Medicines List Antibiotic Book - what it is how it was developed and how it can be used and w hat does WHO expect from the public consultation phase. The topic of antibiotics is extensive and so in this course we shall focus on two main classes.</p>

The antibiotics covered in this book include penicillin viridicatin cyclopaldic acid cephalosporin P bongkrek acid chlamydosporine and flammulin. It starts with an overview of the erosion of the efficacy of antibiotics by resistance and the decrease in the rate of replacement of redundant compounds. The latter include the penicillins and cephalosporins which are still widely used today despite the growing problem of resistance as bacteria evolve effective biochemical defences against these drugs. With the rise of antibiotic resistance and the increasing view that a crisis may be looming in infectious diseases there are strong signs of renewed emphasis in antibiotic research. Mechanisms and New Antimicrobial Approaches discusses up-to-date knowledge in mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and all recent advances in fighting microbial resistance such as the applications of nanotechnology plant products bacteriophages marine products algae insect-derived products and other alternative methods that can be applied to.</p>
