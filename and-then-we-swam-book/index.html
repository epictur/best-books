<p>Instead this book reads like a childs description of what they did on holiday monday we went to the river it was wet and then we went to the bar and drank five beers tuesday we swam and I pushed someone in etc This lacks any thought or detail. But that wouldnt stop rowing rookies Ben Stenning and James Adair from pursuing their dream. Nobody thought theyd make it. We also welcome large group visits and educational group visits. This is one to be avoided. Make Yourdreamstravel With These Monday Blues From Aircanadavacations We Swam In Multiple Grottos Said Cheers At Th St Lucia Resorts St Lucia Us Swimming.</p>
