He was a part of a group of Americans who had volunteered for the British Medical Corp. The leafy Avenue Foch one of the most exclusive residential streets in Nazi-occupied France was Pariss hotbed of daring spies murderous secret police amoral informers and Vichy collaborators. Avenue of Spies is a haunting harrowing tale that reads like an elegant thriller with the added benefit that every word is true. It was hard for me to put down and I eagerly awaited picking up where I left off.
