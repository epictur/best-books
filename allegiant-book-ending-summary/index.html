Do not read if you do not want the book to be spoiled. To me it feels like VR wanted this ending so desperately that she tried to change the plot characters and focus of the trilogy its explained as such a character-driven ending when the books were always far more oriented around action to create a situation in which it could make sense and as a result the whole body of work suffered. It takes huge risks when it comes to the fate of its protagonists and the decisions with which they are confronted. Like I said above there was no other way to end the book and I accept that but if Roth had ended it differently I would have felt the ending was blah but I would have accepted it the only alternative to killing Tris would be to kill for him sacrificing himself for love.
