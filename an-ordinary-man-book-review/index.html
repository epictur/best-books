<p>An Ordinary Man. Id actually wanted to read The Taking Of Annie Thorne when I came across reviews for The Chalk Man. He recalled him as a good man but also as a man of pleasure who dissipated the family fortune and played the grand seigneur in Paris. This commentary is so engaging that it was hard to put down and is well worth the cover to cover read. Betts kept this commentary lively and it delivers a timeless and relevant message for todays church.
