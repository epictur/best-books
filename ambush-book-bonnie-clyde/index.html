<p>The 1st one I bought fell apart I read it a few times. For no matter who believes what concerning the ambush of Bonnie Clyde&ndash; in revealing his come clean version of events that day Hintons account directly or in effect frames all other ambush accounts as told by posse. His nonfiction book was published in 2009 and is one of the most definitive and accurate books about the two celebrity criminals. I have 4 or 5 different books about them. If you like Bonnie and Clyde books this is one of the best. Bonnie And Clyde Ambush Site Floyd Hamilton At The Ambush Site Bonnie Parker Bonnie And Clyde Photos Bonnie And Clyde Car.</p>
