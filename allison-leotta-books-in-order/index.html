<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed each of Allison Leottas books and Speak of the Devil is a terrific addition to her Anna Curtis series. Ten Rules for a Call Girl is a 56-page short story by Allison. SVU former federal sex-crimes prosecutor Allison Leottas novel explores the intersection of sex and power as Anna Curtis investigates the murder of one of DCs highest-paid escorts. Set in suburban Maryland it explores a fascinating crime involving the violent gang MS-13 a brothel a mysterious and terrifying gang leader and a cop whose true motives remain tantalizingly unclear for most of the story.
