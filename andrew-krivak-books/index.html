Andrew Krivak is the author of three novels. Although The Bear was written for adults and compared by many reviewers to Cormac McCarthys The Road readers of all ages have found that it reminds them of beloved books from their childhood such as Jean Craighead Georges My Side of the Mountain Scott ODells Island of the Blue Dolphins and Gary Paulsens Hatchet. In Andrew Krivaks palimpsest novel the reassertion of nature over the bones of human civilization is a dignified and regretless process. Pin On Literary Fiction 2019 Monthly Releases.</p>
