Officially know as The Imperial Radch trilogy the series began with the multi award winning Ancillary Justice first published 2013 followed by Ancillary Sword 2014 and Ancillary Mercy 2015. Ancillary Justice Imperial Radch 1 by Ann Leckie Goodreads Author 397 Rating details 93871 ratings 9244 reviews On a remote icy planet the soldier known as Breq is drawing closer to completing her quest. But then word started to get around on the blogs Ancillary Justice was something special a galaxy-spanning epic with characters and conflicts that took a tired genre in mind.
