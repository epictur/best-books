<h3 id="when-most-people">When most people.</h3><p>A Life can sometimes give you the feeling that the author cant wait for the absurd to quit courting the vulgar but DeCurtis a longtime MVP of the Rolling Stone writers stable knows he cant completely gloss over the seamy abrasive riveting spectacle Reed made of himself in those early post-VU years. 399 Rating details 1144 ratings 173 reviews. The book has been awarded with Penderyn Music Book Prize Nominee for longlist. A man of contradictions and extremes he was fiercely independent yet afraid of being alone artistically fearless yet deeply paranoid eager for commercial success yet disdainful of his own triumphs. Read this book and explore the fcking genius that was Lou ReedPeter Buck co-founder and lead guitarist of REM. Reading DeCurtis account of Reeds heroin addiction was helpful as I tackled this subject when writing about Janis.</p>
