Adrian is the band member who has collaborated on the most side projects outside of Iron Maiden as well as writing and recording a series of solo albums in the early 1990s before rejoining the band. Contrary to popular belief it was Smiths Chronopia art that got my interest more than his GW work. Beginning his career at Games Workshop in the late 1980s he has gone on to work on a multitude of magazine and book covers and as a concept artist for games developers EA Mythic and UbisoftHis books include Imago published by Seoul Visual Works. Its the wrong book Its the wrong edition Other. So I was browsing google for Adrian smith art work and lo and behold he has jumped aboard the deviant wagon.</p>
