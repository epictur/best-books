The hero of Dave Eggerss absorbing new novel A Hologram for the King is a penny-ante Job named Alan Clay who finds himself in an absurd situation. Im not sure how many of you have felt the great 2007-2009 Economic Recession.</p>
<h3 id="tom-hanks-stars-in-the-mediocre-comedic-drama-a-hologram-for-the-king">Tom Hanks stars in the mediocre comedic drama A Hologram for the King.</h3><p>The story never goes anywhere and then ends abruptly with more dissapointment. It was adapted as a film of the same name released in 2016 and starring Tom Hanks and Sarita Choudhury. Recently divorced she also has children whom she worries have suffered because of her broken marriage. With hints of parable Eggers explores a modern-day quandary in both national and personal identity explored through mid-life crisis and cultural clashes. Its a disappointment then when A Hologram for the King transitions this anti-fatalism into a succession of epiphanies you can get wholesale. The way economy works in the novel seems to suggest that money is the unseen solution to his problems but in the end he loses the deal and gets the deal.</p>
