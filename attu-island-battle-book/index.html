<p>The Japanese had taken the island which was thinly populated by native Aleuts whose history on that island went. In May 1943 US forces clashed with Japanese invaders in an epic battle on the Alaskan island of Attu. We cannot guarantee that every book is in the library. The ruggedly beautiful island of Attu in the Aleutian chain of islands that are part of Alaska was the site of the only land battle fought on US. The Capture of Attu first published in 1944 recounts first the history of the westernmost Aleutian Island - Attu - then provides many firsthand stories of the infantrymen fighting in this incredibly harsh and rugged island against an enemy determined to fight to the last man.
