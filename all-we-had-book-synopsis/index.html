<p>In ALL WE HAD Rita Katie Holmes is a single mom who seems to bounce from one bad boyfriend to another eventually skipping town when the relationship has run its course &ndash; always with her teenage daughter Ruthie Stefania Owen in tow. I liked rose and miig the best peobably because their past lives were described in much more. Cast Katie Holmes as Rita Carmichael Stefania LaVie Owen as Ruthie Carmichael Luke Wilson as Lee Richard Kind as Marty. This book had so much potential and i really liked the elders storytelling in the middle of the book but it didnt deliver as i had hoped. The economic crash is so brutal that even Ruthie feels it riding her bike past empty storefronts.

<p>I enjoyed this book very much. I LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH. Dec 09 2016 All We Had. It is a book steeped in reality with an all too human single mother trying to do her best for her daughter at the same time appearing to be utterly selfish in her behaviour which could be seen as compromising the safety of the daughter she loves so much. So it stands to reason that as you begin writing. Lceypfblfk6grm.</p>
