<p>LotR has a very different style. The Lord of the Rings. The best way in my opinion to read the Lord of the Rings canon is as follows. Conclusion Is Lord Of The Rings Difficult Or Easy To Read The books are amazing but they can be tough to read especially if you are not native. There is nothing particularly difficult about the book other than its being long and in some peoples experience slow-paced. Pin On Books Worth Reading.</p>

<p>The Fellowship of the Ring. In fact I dont read at all. Is Lord of the Rings hard to read. Its easy to understand why The Lord of the Rings adaptations leave this ending out &ndash; just when the Hobbits reach what they think is the end of their journey they are faced with a fight for their home with no help from Men Elves or DwarvesWhile the films provide a neat bow-tie ending and give a definite sense of closure it leaves out the epitome of the Hobbits fortitude. It originally began as a sequel to the 1937 childrens tale The Hobbit. Pin On Heartsmile Books.</p>
