<p>As for me the last 600 page book I read took about 7 days still having to do my day job etc etc On average i will read 100 pages in 3 hours. Its using the 8020 rule. Reading difficulty should be considered as well as for most it may take longer to read an old. Well it depends on my interest and the size of text on the page. So the metric being proposed here is inexact and requires some assumptions.

<p>It would take 18 hours for me to read 600 pages but i also tend to start slower getting a grasp for the characters world style etc then speed up quite a bit. These numbers may encourage or discourage you but hang tight. For a standard-size page and font I can read around 160 pages an hour. So the metric being proposed here is inexact and requires some assumptions. Help is on the way. The Book By Timur Kickstarter Books Book Gifts I Love Books.</p>

<p>Since I rarely read at home and almost exclusively read while commuting daily on the train big behemoths like this can take me a long time. So the metric being proposed here is inexact and requires some assumptions. It depends on the density of the books contents but in general I read around 110-120 pages per hour. 12 83 votes 2 days.
