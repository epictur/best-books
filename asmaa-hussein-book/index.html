<p>Theyre personal heavy and yet so uplifting. Two years ago Asmaa Husseins life changed forever. These entries were written during the two years following Amrs departure from this world. Keemya Parsa Since its release A Temporary Gift has reached readers around the world and continues to bring solace to wounded hearts. I really take my hat off to Asmaa Hussein for writing and publishing books like this one and like Bismillah Soup that give children the chance to experience another culture through a book.
